Terrain features should not be smaller than 3\" in any dimension or larger than 6\" in any dimension. However, if your terrain is larger or smaller, consider adjusting the amount of terrain as necessary. For example, a single terrain piece consisting of an obstruction on a hill, built alongside a beautiful pond, with a footprint approximately 15\" in diameter should be treated as three pieces of terrain. Do not be afraid to use terrain that is strange and varied; after all, the world is made up of more than hills, forests, and walls!"

As a rule of thumb: If three small pieces of terrain fit into the same area as a single piece of normal terrain, those pieces are scatter terrain. Scatter terrain is removed from the table when it is contacted by an 80mm-based or 120mm-based model.
